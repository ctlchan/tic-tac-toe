# tic-tac-toe
## Introduction
A simple game of tic tac toe! Play against a friend, or a bot, or watch 2 bots go head to head!

## Context
This project was built as a part of The Odin Project's curriculum. This project was designed to help learners like myself put into practice the recently-learned concepts of Factory functions and using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) to create objects. 

As an added challenge, this project implements AI opponents with 4 different levels of difficulty. For simplicity's sake, the level set for the AI determines the likelihood that it makes a move following the minimax algorithm over a random move. At 'Easy', the AI will always make a random move, whilie at 'Impossible', the AI will always make a move following the minimax algorithm.
